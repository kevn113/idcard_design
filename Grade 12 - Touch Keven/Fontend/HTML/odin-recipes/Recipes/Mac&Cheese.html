<h1>Homemade Mac and Cheese</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni    </a>
        <li><a>¼ cup salted butter        </a>
            <li><a>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour            </a>
                <li><a>2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed                </a>
                    <li><a>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese                    </a>
                        <li><a>½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese                        </a>
                            <li><a>salt and ground black pepper to taste                            </a>
</ul>
<h1>Directions</h1>
<ul>
    <li><a>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</a>
        <li><a>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</a>
            <li><a>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</a>
                <li><a>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.</a>
                    <li><a>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed.</a>
                        <li><a>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</a>
                            <li><a>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned.</a>
                                <li><a>Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.                                </a>
                                    <li><a>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.                                    </a>
                            
                            
                    
</ul>
